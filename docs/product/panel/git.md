# Git UI

Layer: [Panel](README.md). Index: [features.md](../features.md).

- Owner: Panel. History data comes from Host HTTP.
- Operations: [readHistory](../owner-surface.md#readhistory) and [readCommit](../owner-surface.md#readcommit).
- Output: a list of commits (id, message, time) and a detail with per-file add/del counts and a text preview.
- Failure: no history capability hides the control. A failed load shows the host error in the browse pane. No message uses the panel label. An empty history shows the empty state.
- Non-goals: reset or commit from the panel. Reset is an authoring tool. There is no revert tool. The panel does not pretend a preview is a full diff viewer of every line when the payload is a preview.

## Implementation


Role: consumer. `PanelHistory` calls an injected client and `useReducer`. The surface passes the focused app id, or the injected id when nothing is open, and remounts the list when that id changes. The list shows each commit's id, message, and time. A close control on the pane hides it; the toolbar control still toggles it. No history client hides the control. Reset stays an authoring tool. This package does not name a host route. Plan: [implementation.md](../implementation.md).
