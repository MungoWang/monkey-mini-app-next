# Author surface

The authoring agent uses this surface. Names are `mini_app_*`. MCP and the HTTP invoke route are two projections of one implementation. A projection does not define a second result.

The agent does not receive the app `ctx` bag. It does not delete the app directory. It does not curl Host as a substitute for these operations.

`mini_app_write`, `mini_app_edit`, and `mini_app_delete` stay on HTTP invoke only. MCP omits them. The [author skill](author-skill/skill-contract.md) does not document those three names; agents use their own file tools for source bytes.

Paths are app-relative. `..` and an absolute path emit `path-escape`. Listing skips history metadata, storage, `node_modules`, `theme.json`, `logs`, `dist`, `.cache`, and `.autogen`. `coverage` is listed. A batch size, a file window, and a history list limit are host policy and are not locked.

Codes are in [implementation.md](implementation.md).

## Catalog

| Operation | Input | Output | Failure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mini_app_list` | none | `{ apps, runtimeRoot }` | empty list when none exist; Host down is a transport error |
| `mini_app_get` | `appId` | manifest summary and absolute directory | `app-not-registered` |
| `mini_app_list_files` | `appId` | relative paths and sizes | `app-not-registered` |
| `mini_app_read` | `appId`, `path`, optional line window, optional `numbered` | `{ path, content, bytes, totalLines, startLine, endLine, truncated? }` | `file-missing`, `path-escape` |
| `mini_app_edit` | `appId`, `path`, `edits: [{ oldText, newText }]`, optional `commit` | updated file, commit status | `edit-not-unique`, `file-missing` |
| `mini_app_write` | `appId`, `path`, `content`, optional `commit` | created or replaced file | `path-escape`, `path-is-directory` |
| `mini_app_delete` | `appId`, `path`, optional `commit` | file removed | `manifest-protected`, `file-missing`. Required entries cannot be deleted. Another owner may mark more paths protected. |
| `mini_app_register` | `appId`, `name`, `description`, `version`, optional `acronym`, `tags`, `kind` | `{ directory, needed }` plus the list summary. `needed` is the absolute paths of `ui.tsx` and `main.api.ts`. A `files` field is rejected. | `app-id-invalid`, `manifest-invalid`, `app-duplicate` |
| `mini_app_reload` | `appId`, optional `cleanCaches` | compile result | codes on [compile.md](host/compile.md) |
| `mini_app_install` | `appId`, optional packages to add or remove, optional `commit` | `{ ok, packages, lockfile }` or `{ ok: false, code }` | `install-denied`, `install-failed` |
| `mini_app_call` | `appId` plus one `method`/`args`, or `calls` | one result, or one result per entry | `unknown-method`; one entry's failure does not drop the others |
| `mini_app_open` | `appId`, optional `title` | `{ panel: "notified" \| "no-panel-connected" }` | `app-not-registered` |
| `mini_app_errors` | `appId`, optional `since`, optional `clear` | `{ errors, lastSeq, dropped, emptyHint? }` | `app-not-registered` |
| `mini_app_view_eval` | `appId`, optional `code`, optional budget fields | view envelope | `app-not-registered`; a timeout returns `view`, it does not hang |
| `mini_app_history_commit` | `appId`, `message` | new commit id, or clean | `history-empty-message` |
| `mini_app_history_list` | `appId`, optional `limit` | `{ head, nodes, tips }` | `app-not-registered` |
| `mini_app_history_reset` | `appId`, `commitId` | `{ head, backupRef, changed, files }` | `history-unknown-commit` |
| `mini_app_mcp_list` | none | `{ servers: [{ id, tools: string[] }] }` — tool names only | one server may carry `mcp-not-connected` or `mcp-start-failed`; the rest still list. No descriptions, schemas, or `env`. |
| `mini_app_mcp_tools` | `serverId`, optional `toolName` | `{ id, tools: [{ name, description?, inputSchema }] }` for that server | server start failures return `{ id, error }` with `mcp-not-connected` or `mcp-start-failed`. Unknown `toolName` is `tool-args`. No `env`. |
| `mini_app_mcp_add` | `id`, then `command` with optional `args`/`env`, or `url` with optional `transport`/`headers`; optional `description`, `enabled`, `check`, `force` | `{ added, id, check?, servers }` | A row with neither `command` nor `url`, an unknown `transport`, or a non-text `env`/`headers` value is `tool-args`. A failed check returns `added: false` and leaves the file and the client alone unless `force` is true. `check: false` skips the check. The written set is handed to the live client, so the server is usable at once. |
| `mini_app_mcp_remove` | `id` | `{ removed, id, servers }` | An unknown id changes nothing and returns `removed: false`. The live client loses the server at once. |
| `mini_app_credential_list` | none | `{ credentials: [{ name, description }] }` | `credential-unreadable`. No secret. Not on `ctx`. |

An empty `mini_app_install` reads the current set. Mutating tools commit unless `commit` is false. `false` batches until reload or an explicit commit. The agent creates, updates, and deletes source files with its own file tools. A successful reload of a dirty tree commits that tree. A failed reload does not.

Both MCP write tools mask the values that a name segment or a value shape identifies as a credential. A recognized label stays, because it is what says what the value is — `Bearer ab*****gh`, `ghp_12*****90` — and the body behind it keeps its first and last two characters, or none of it under five. An ordinary setting such as `NODE_ENV` comes back unchanged. The file keeps the true values, and the panel reads them to edit them.

`GET /api/tools` and `POST /api/tools/invoke` mount the whole catalog, including `mini_app_write`, `mini_app_edit`, and `mini_app_delete`. MCP `tools/list` and `tools/call` omit those three. An MCP call of an omitted name is `unknown-tool` and names the MCP catalog.

Mounted: `createAuthorTools` is the one implementation. `GET /api/tools`, `POST /api/tools/invoke`, and `POST /mcp` (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`) project it. A missing or wrong token is `authoring-token`. A non-loopback caller is `authoring-loopback`. An unknown name is `unknown-tool` and names the catalog that projection mounts. History commit, list, and reset are mounted. A tree change calls `onTreeChanged` and publishes `app:reload`. `mini_app_open` publishes `app:open` and returns `notified` only when a host-stream subscriber is attached. `mini_app_errors` reads the error ring. `mini_app_install` is mounted. It is the only writer of `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. `mini_app_view_eval` is mounted. No subscriber returns `not-open` immediately. A subscriber with no frame also returns `not-open` immediately. A second call while that app's view is still answering returns `pending`. A timeout returns `runner-not-booted` or `stuck` and does not hang. The iframe runs the code; Host only routes `app:eval`. Delete is not an authoring tool. `mini_app_mcp_add` and `mini_app_mcp_remove` are the only writers of the MCP server file, and a write hands the live client the specs it just wrote, so `ctx.mcp` and the authoring tools see the change without a restart. `mini_app_mcp_list`, `mini_app_mcp_tools`, `mini_app_mcp_add`, `mini_app_mcp_remove`, and `mini_app_credential_list` are not on `ctx`.

There is no migration tool. The agent writes `schema/NNN_name.sql`. One file is one transaction: create or alter app tables, seed rows, or rewrite existing rows. Do not ship a one-shot TypeScript loop of `ctx.storage.run` for that work. A file that has not been applied can be edited or deleted. A file that has been applied is changed by adding the next number, not by deleting it. Deleting an applied file fails the next open with `storage-migration`. Opening storage, including reload and the next call, applies pending files.

`mini_app_open` returning `no-panel-connected` means the app is fine and no panel is attached.

`mini_app_view_eval` omitted `code` returns the document root. Injected names are `mma.$`, `mma.$$`, and `mma.selector`. No fourth name. `view` is `live`, `not-open`, `runner-not-booted`, `pending`, or `stuck`. Only `stuck` means the main thread is blocked.

## History restore

There is one history-moving operation. `mini_app_history_reset` makes the working tree and the branch match `commitId`. That is `git reset --hard <commitId>`, plus a backup ref so the previous head stays a reachable leaf of the commit tree. If the tree already matches that commit, the result is `changed: false` and no backup ref is written.

When `changed` is true, the previous head is stored as a backup ref and returned as `backupRef`. That ref is a pointer, not a branch. It exists so the commits `main` no longer points at can still be found. `mini_app_history_list` returns those pointers in `tips` as `{ name, commitId }`, beside the `main` tip.

To undo a reset, call `mini_app_history_reset` again with that backup `commitId`. `main` returns to the head from before the first reset. The head just left becomes the new backup ref.

Undoing one commit while keeping later commits is not a tool. The author reads that snapshot and edits forward.

When `changed` is true, Host tells an already-open view to refetch. A call that returns an id and leaves the open view on the previous bundle is not a completed restore.

## Non-goals

- A tool that deletes the app.
- A tool that writes outside the app directory.
- Re-exporting `ctx`, or external MCP servers, on this surface.
- A second tool schema on the MCP projection.
