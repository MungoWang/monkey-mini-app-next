/**
 * Entrance reveal — fade and rise, with a per-item `delay` for a stagger.
 *
 * This is the kit's front door to the platform `motion` build (`/mma/vendors/motion.js`,
 * one shared React). Use it for the common case and reach for
 * `import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "motion/react"` when you need exit, layout,
 * or gesture animation — `AnimatePresence` in particular is what keeps a removing row
 * from vanishing mid-transition.
 *
 * @when A card, row, or section appearing on first paint or after a filter change. Not
 *   for a hover/press response (one property: use a Tailwind `transition`) and not for
 *   animating an element out (use `AnimatePresence`).
 * @example
 * {rows.map((r, i) => (
 *   <Reveal key={r.id} delay={i * 60}>
 *     <Card>{r.title}</Card>
 *   </Reveal>
 * ))}
 * @family Animation
