/**
 * shiki arrives from `https://esm.sh/shiki@…` at runtime (see the CDN note in
 * `code-block.tsx` and hard constraint #12 in AGENTS.md), so it is deliberately not a
 * dependency and not bundled. That has a testing consequence worth stating plainly:
 * **highlighting cannot be asserted here.** This project has no network, the dynamic import
 * rejects, and the component takes its documented degrade path.
 *
 * What this does pin is the part that matters offline and is easy to get wrong: a failed
 * CDN must still show the code. A `CodeBlock` that renders an empty box when esm.sh is
 * unreachable is a data-loss bug wearing a styling costume. Actual highlight output is
 * covered in a real browser, not by a unit test reaching for the network.
