# Tape

Also known as `行情带` (sample product copy).

id: `tape` · grammar: `numeral-strip`

**When:** Watch board, quotes, incident strip. Tabular numerals, vertical rules, colour = delta only.

**Not:** Homes, forms. No graph-paper grid, no card chrome.


## Classes (copy literals)

- `root`: `h-full min-h-0 bg-background font-mono`
- `nums`: `grid grid-cols-4 divide-x divide-border`
- `num`: `px-4 py-5 text-3xl font-medium tracking-tight tabular-nums`

This look follows the host palette on purpose — no `theme.css`.

Tokens only — no hex in `ui.tsx`. Light and dark must both read. There is no `data-look` attribute.
